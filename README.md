# Travel the World
This is my final project for Coding 1. The website contains three main pages: Home, About, and Contact. It includes a functioning navigation menu, styled content, an image carousel, and my own branding. The about page features a short bio and a personal photo, while the contact page provides ways to reach me. I also added a custom logo in the top-left corner and included a footer with a GitHub link. All pages are styled using an external CSS file. I created this site to reflect my personality and growing skills in HTML, CSS, and web design.
